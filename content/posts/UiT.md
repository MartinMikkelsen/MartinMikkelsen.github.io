### Introduction
I recently attended the Northern Lights Deep Learning ([NLDL](https://www.nldl.org/home)) conference at UiT in Troms√∏, Norway. I presented a poster on my work on quantum-inspired machine learning, which is a new approach to solving partial differential equations using tensor networks and machine learning techniques
