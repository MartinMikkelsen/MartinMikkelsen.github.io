### Introduction

This thesis presents a study on pion photoproduction off nucleons near the threshold, utilizing a nuclear model that incorporates explicit mesons. The approach deviates from conventional potential-based interactions between nucleons, focusing instead on meson emissions and absorptions.

### Model overview


The core aspect of this model is the explicit treatment of mesons, rather than describing nucleon interactions through a potential. This approach is based on the premise that nucleons interact by emitting and absorbing mesons. The study limits its scope to the one meson approximation, simplifying the complex interactions within the system. This approximation is crucial for focusing on specific interactions without the computational complexity of multiple meson exchanges. The thesis specifically targets cases where the mesons involved are pions. This choice is due to the significance of pions in nuclear physics and their role in nucleon interactions.

### Conclusion

The thesis provides insights into the dynamics of pion photoproduction using a novel meson-based nuclear model. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of nucleon interactions and offer a different perspective from traditional potential-based models.
