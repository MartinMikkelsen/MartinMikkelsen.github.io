### Abstract

We apply the nuclear model with explicit mesons to photoproduction of neutral pions off protons at the threshold. In this model the nucleons do not interact with each other via a potential but rather emit and absorb mesons that are treated explicitly on equal footing with the nucleons. We calculate the total cross section of the reaction for energies close to threshold and compare the calculations with available experimental data. We show that the model is able to reproduce the experimental data and determine the range of the parameters where the model is compatible with the experiment.
